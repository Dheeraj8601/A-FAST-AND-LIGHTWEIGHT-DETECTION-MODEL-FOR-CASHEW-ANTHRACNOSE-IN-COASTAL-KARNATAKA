# A FAST AND LIGHTWEIGHT DETECTION MODEL FOR CASHEW ANTHRACNOSE IN COASTAL KARNATAKA

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fwfc_5jFW0Nf_bxNVxRfESQT5lE3Yo8x?usp=drive_link).

## Saved Model
The trained model can be downloaded from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1K5IUGquqRK_rdlvrw7VLsWOIUbnwxWFN/view?usp=drive_link).

## Model Training
The `new_bufferless.ipynb` file contains the code for training the model. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed before running the notebook.

## Frontend
The `frontend` folder contains the code for the front-end development. This includes all necessary files for running the web interface for the detection model.

## API
The `api` folder contains the FastAPI code, which handles CORS, model loading, and prediction APIs. Follow the instructions in the `api` folder to set up and run the FastAPI server.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Download the dataset and saved model using the provided links.
3. Follow the instructions in the `new_bufferless.ipynb` file to train the model if needed.
4. Set up the front-end by navigating to the `frontend` folder and following the instructions there.
5. Set up the API by navigating to the `api` folder and following the instructions there.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- FastAPI
- Any additional libraries as mentioned in `new_bufferless.ipynb` and `api` folder requirements.

## Usage
1. Start the FastAPI server to handle model predictions.
2. Open the front-end application to interact with the model and make predictions on new data.
